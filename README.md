## Goals

The MAKARA project (Multi-Architecture Knowledge Analysis and Report Assessment) is designed to rigorously test the depth of understanding possessed by Large Language Models (LLMs) regarding the foundational principles of computer architecture. The primary goal is to determine if an LLM can effectively translate program execution behavior across different hardware environments. Specifically, the project challenges an LLM with a given program's source code and its corresponding performance counter metrics gathered from an initial architecture (Architecture A). The central objective is then to query the LLM to predict and project how those same performance counters would appear if the identical program were executed on a distinct target architecture (Architecture B). This cross-domain performance projection serves as a crucial metric for assessing the LLM's true architectural reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere data pattern recognition to validate its grasp of the underlying hardware-software interaction principles.
